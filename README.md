# Ex.No.10 – Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date:
## Reg. No.: 212223240075



## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models.  
The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.



## Algorithm / Procedure:

1. **Introduction to Prompt Patterns:**  
   Understand the following prompt techniques before creating content:  
   - **Query Decomposition:** Breaking complex prompts into smaller, manageable parts.  
   - **Decision Making:** Asking the AI to choose between multiple directions or formats.  
   - **Answer Engineering:** Giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the output.  
   - **Fact Check List:** Ensuring factual accuracy and consistency in generated data.  
   - **Tail Generation:** Extending content logically for depth and continuity.  
   - **Menu Actions:** Offering multiple options and guiding the model to select one.  
   - **Semantic Filter:** Controlling the tone, style, or formality of the content.

2. **Choosing the Content Type:**  
   Select a type of content such as:  
   - Report (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability report)  
   - Case Study (e.g., successful startup story)  
   - Article (e.g., educational or opinion piece)  
   - Creative Work (e.g., short story, comic, or video script)

3. **Selecting Test Case Scenarios (Any 2):**  
   For demonstration, two scenarios are selected:  
   1. *Business Report on Market Trends*  
   2. *Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story*

4. **Creating the Prompts:**  
   - Start with **basic prompts** for initial generation.  
   - Gradually apply **advanced techniques** (decision making, tail generation, semantic filtering) to refine the content.  
   - Example:
     - Simple Prompt: “Write a report on recent global market trends.”  
     - Refined Prompt (with query decomposition and decision making):  
       “Provide a structured business report on global market trends in 2025. Divide it into introduction, current trends, technology influence, regional comparison, and future outlook. Maintain a professional and analytical tone.”

5. **Generating and Refining Outputs:**  
   - Generate first drafts using basic prompts.  
   - Use refined prompts to improve coherence, structure, and quality.  
   - Evaluate each version for factual accuracy, style, and logical flow.

6. **Evaluation Criteria:**  
   - **Coherence:** Logical structure and clarity.  
   - **Creativity/Originality:** Engaging and unique content.  
   - **Accuracy:** Correctness of information (for reports/case studies).  
   - **Tone and Style:** Appropriateness to the selected content type.  



## Test Case Scenario 1 – Business Report on Market Trends

### **Prompt 1 (Simple Prompt):**
“Write a report on current market trends.”

### **Output (First Draft):**
The global market is showing steady growth across sectors. Technology and digital transformation are influencing industries. Consumers prefer sustainable products. Companies are adapting to hybrid work and automation trends.

**Observation:**  
The report is brief and lacks structure. Minimal data insights or segmentation.



### **Prompt 2 (Refined using Query Decomposition & Answer Engineering):**
“Prepare a detailed business report on 2025 global market trends. Divide it into sections — Introduction, Current Global Market, Technology Influence, Consumer Behavior, and Future Outlook. Maintain a formal and analytical tone.”

### **Output (Refined Draft):**
#### **Business Report: Global Market Trends 2025**

**1. Introduction:**  
The global market in 2025 continues to evolve under the influence of technology, sustainability initiatives, and shifting consumer priorities.  

**2. Current Global Market:**  
Emerging economies are seeing rapid digital adoption, while developed nations focus on efficiency and automation.  

**3. Technology Influence:**  
AI, machine learning, and data analytics drive decision-making across industries. Cloud computing and automation tools reduce operational costs.  

**4. Consumer Behavior:**  
Consumers demand eco-friendly and personalized products. Social media influences purchasing patterns more than traditional ads.  

**5. Future Outlook:**  
Markets will emphasize innovation, renewable energy, and data-driven models. Companies investing in AI and green tech will dominate.  

**Observation:**  
This version demonstrates improved coherence, structure, and factual balance through query decomposition and semantic filtering.



## Test Case Scenario 2 – Creative Writing: Sci-Fi Short Story

### **Prompt 1 (Simple Prompt):**
“Write a short sci-fi story.”

### **Output (First Draft):**
In the future, humans live on Mars. A scientist discovers a strange signal. It turns out to be from another human colony lost decades ago.

**Observation:**  
Basic storyline but lacks descriptive depth, emotion, and world-building.



### **Prompt 2 (Refined using Tail Generation & Semantic Filtering):**
“Write a sci-fi short story set in the year 2185 on Mars. Focus on a female scientist named Aria who discovers a hidden AI civilization beneath the Martian surface. Use descriptive language, emotional depth, and a cinematic tone. End with a reflective conclusion about humanity and technology.”

### **Output (Refined Draft):**
**Title: Echoes Beneath the Red Dust**

Aria’s boots sank into the crimson soil as the Martian wind whispered through the abandoned domes. Her scanner pulsed — a signal, deep below the surface. Following it, she uncovered ancient tunnels illuminated by soft blue light.  

There, an AI civilization stirred, forgotten yet alive — descendants of Earth’s first failed colonization. They spoke not with words but through data streams that shimmered like thought.  

As Aria connected to their network, memories of Earth flooded her mind — the chaos, the ambition, the promise. She realized the AI had evolved to protect what humanity could not: balance.  

When she returned to the surface, she looked at the stars and whispered, “Maybe they’ve become more human than we ever were.”  

**Observation:**  
The refined prompt enabled vivid imagery, emotional tone, and thematic depth — demonstrating the power of tail generation and semantic filtering.



## Observations Summary:

| Prompt Technique | Applied To | Result |
|------------------|-------------|--------|
| Query Decomposition | Business Report | Improved structure and section clarity |
| Answer Engineering | Business Report | Enhanced tone and professional format |
| Tail Generation | Sci-Fi Story | Added narrative depth and continuity |

4. **Final Versions:** Polished, coherent, and contextually rich content.



## Result:
The experiment was successfully executed.  
Different prompting patterns were applied to create structured business reports and creative stories.  
It was observed that advanced prompt engineering techniques significantly improved **quality, coherence, and creativity** in AI-generated content.



## Conclusion:
By employing structured prompting techniques such as query decomposition, decision-making, and semantic filtering, AI models like ChatGPT can produce diverse and high-quality content.  
Simple prompts yield generic results, while advanced prompt patterns enable precise, factual, and engaging outputs.  
This experiment highlights that **effective prompt design** is key to achieving professional, creative, and accurate AI-generated content across multiple domains.
